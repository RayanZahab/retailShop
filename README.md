# The Discount Shop

## In our retail shop, the following discounts apply:
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
5. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.

## Special discounts 
On holidays (Ramadan, Adha, Fitr, New year) we add new discounts based on marchandise types: 
1. grocery 15%
2. electronics below 100$ 3% , electronics that costs >100$ get a 7.5% discount

Items on special discounts do not get included in base discounts
